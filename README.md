# Agent OwO Tools
### Description
For the assignment that turned into Agent OwO we had to create a game using our own c++ engine. This also meant there were no GUI editors available for the engine. For more info on the Agent OwO project see the [Agent OwO repository][1].

During the project I made a couple of tools in Unity. I created the tools for Unity because the designers were already familiar with Unity.

#### Lua File Generator
I made a tool that would write game objects with a specific monobehaviour to a lua file. I made two versions of the monobehaviour one for UI and the other for gameplay objects. After finishing what they were working on they could easily save their work to a lua file by entering play mode in Unity and pressing **S** for gameplay objects and **E** for UI objects.

#### Grid Generator
The grid generator allowed the designers to quickly create 2D grids by passing in the amount of rows and columns. Additionaly designers could specify how many and where gameplay objects were supposed to be placed on the grid. This allowed the designers to quickly iterate on the levels.

#### Tutorials
I made step by step tutorials to accompany the tools. Besides just written text there were picture examples to make sure everything was as clear as possible. Thanks to these tutorials designers could easily use the tools I made.
